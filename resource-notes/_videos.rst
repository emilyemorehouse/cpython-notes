* `Allison Kaptur - Byterun: A (C)Python interpretor in Python <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVUTjQzESeo>`_
	- PyCon 2015 talk:
		Have you ever wondered how the CPython interpreter works? Do you know where
		to find a 1,500 line switch statement in CPython? I'll talk about the
		structure of the interpreter that we all use every day by explaining how Ned Batchelder and I chased down a mysterious bug in Byterun, a Python
		interpreter written in Python. We'll also see visualizations of the VM as it executes your code.

* `Allison Kaptur - Exploring is never boring: understanding CPython without reading the code <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSIRGLmQTLk>`_
	- PyCon 2015 talk:
		Have you started to read the source code of CPython but not gotten as far as you wanted? Maybe you want to understand more about CPython but don't know where to begin. I'll present a number of strategies for getting more familiar with Python under the hood that go beyond ""just read it!"" This talk isn't about contributing - it's about getting into the code base and discovering interesting things.
