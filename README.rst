cpython-notes
=============

This repository contains notes from my personal journey of diving into CPython.

The primary goal of these notes is to establish a place where knowledge can be
found, and that knowledge can be organized and disseminated in some sort of unified
way. If these notes / resources lists / etc. can be of use to others, please feel
free to use this information as well as add to it.

The secondary goal of this is to eventually coalesce parts of this information
into an informative guided tour of CPython. Further goals, collaboration, and a
status of this ongoing work can be found at pyladies/pyladies-maintainers#6.

The format chosen for these documents is RST, where appropriate. Though Markdown
would have also been a perfectly valid choice, RST was chosen to stay consistent
with the Python documentation if any pieces of this should be added to those
resources at any point.

* cpython-notes:
	- This directory contains notes that I have compiled directly from wandering around the CPython codebase.
* general-notes:
	- This directory contains notes on the direction of the CPython guide, in collaboration with others (again, this converation can currently be tracked here: pyladies/pyladies-maintainers#6)
* meeting-notes:
	- This directory contains notes from my meetings with other contributors, core devs, aspiring core devs, lovers of technical writing and open source, etc.
* resource-notes:
	- This directory contains lists of available resources, currently divided into files based on type. Lists of resources are denoted by an underscore (``_``) at the beginning of the filename. Notes on these resources are also kept within this directory, named based on the author and title of said resource. Progress is also tracked in both list and notes files, containing a loosely structured format of the date notes were taken, duration of time spent on a resource, and the number of "passes" through a resource (I suspect that some of these resoureces will require multiple passes to retain all information).
